## Values

### Academic Honesty Policy Statement

Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty including but not limited to cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty, is prohibited in all programs of the University. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. The procedures outlined below are intended to provide an efficient and orderly process by which action may be taken if it appears that academic dishonesty has occurred and by which students may appeal such actions. Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent.

For more information about what constitutes academic dishonesty, please see the [Dean of Students' website](http://umass.edu/dean_students/honesty/).

### Disability Statement

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities and help create a barrier-free campus. If you are in need of accommodation for a documented disability, register with Disability Services to have an accommodation letter sent to your faculty. It is your responsibility to initiate these services and to communicate with faculty ahead of time to manage accommodations in a timely manner. For more information, consult the [Disability Services website](http://www.umass.edu/disability/).

### Title IX

In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 that prohibits gender-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funds, the University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students, free from all forms of discrimination, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. This includes interactions in person or online through digital platforms and social media. Title IX also protects against discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, or related conditions, including recovery. There are resources here on campus to support you. A summary of the available Title IX resources (confidential and non-confidential) can be found at the following link: [Title IX Resources](https://www.umass.edu/titleix/resources). You do not need to make a formal report to access them. If you need immediate support, you are not alone. Free and confidential support is available 24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 days a year at the SASA Hotline 413-545-0800.

### Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Related Interpersonal Violence

In synergy with the aspirations of our department and the college, I strive to ensure that my classroom is a place where all students can not only succeed, but also thrive. Federal and state laws as well as University policies provide several protections to support these efforts.

The University of Massachusetts Amherst, through this Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Related Interpersonal Violence prohibits unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on the basis of race, color, religion, caste, creed, sex, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pregnancy and pregnancy-related condition(s), age, marital status, national origin, mental or physical disability, political belief or affiliation, veteran status, genetic information, natural and protective hairstyle, and any other legally protected class of individuals protected from discrimination under state or federal law in any aspect of the access to, admission, employment, or treatment in the University's educational program and activity. The University affirms its commitment to provide a welcoming and respectful work and educational environment, in which all individuals within the University community may benefit from each other's experiences and foster mutual respect and appreciation of divergent views. Any member of the campus community, guest, or other person who acts to deny or limit the access to educational, employment, residential, and/or social programs or activities, benefits, and/or opportunities of any (other) member of the campus community, guest, or visitor on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in classes protected by this Policy will be in violation of this Policy.

## Wellness and Success

You are not alone at UMass—many people care about your well-being and many resources are available to help you thrive and succeed. During this time, you may be experiencing pressures related to health, money, family, and academic concerns or stress and trauma from societal inequities and violence. Coursework is challenging and classes are not the only demand in your life. You have resilience and are already using effective strategies to help you achieve your educational goals. Take stock of these and consider what new steps or resources could be helpful. Getting enough sleep, exercising, eating well, and connecting with others are all antidotes to stress.

If you are struggling academically, reach out to your instructors and advisors prior to deadlines and before the demands of exams, papers, and projects reach their peak. Students experiencing challenges including stress, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, loneliness, and trauma, or who feel down or alienated, can find it helpful to connect with one or more of the many supportive resources on campus that stand ready to assist you. You matter at UMass.
